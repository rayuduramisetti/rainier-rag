The park was established in 1899 as the fifth national park in the United States. It encompasses 369 square miles of diverse ecosystems, from old-growth temperate rainforests to alpine meadows and glacial peaks.

Mount Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world due to its proximity to the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area. The mountain's extensive glacier system poses additional risks due to potential lahars (volcanic mudflows).

The park receives over 2 million visitors annually, with peak visitation during the summer months of July through September when most high-elevation areas become accessible.""",

**Seasonal Patterns:**
Winter (December-February): Heavy snowfall, with most high-elevation areas inaccessible. Paradise area typically receives 600+ inches of snow annually. Only lower elevation trails remain open.

Spring (March-May): Snowmelt begins, but high elevation areas remain snow-covered. Weather is highly variable with frequent rain and occasional snow. Many trails remain closed due to snow conditions.

Summer (June-August): Best hiking weather with most trails accessible by July. Wildflowers peak in July-August. Temperatures range from 50-70Â°F at Paradise level. High elevation areas may still have snow patches.

Fall (September-November): Beautiful autumn colors, cooler temperatures, and fewer crowds. First snows typically arrive in October at elevation. Many high-elevation trails close by November.

**Weather Safety:**
- Always check current conditions before hiking
- Weather can change from sunny to stormy within hours
- Hypothermia is possible even in summer
- Carry rain gear and warm layers year-round
- Lightning strikes are common during afternoon thunderstorms""",
